# Sales_Prediction_With_Python

Hello, connections! 👋I'm excited to share my project named Sales price prediction with python.🚀

🔍 Data Exploration: Armed with Python's powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.This dataset held the keys to TV, Radio, Newspaper advertising budgets, and Sales figures.

💡Unearthing Insights: Armed with visualizations like box plots and correlation matrices and it's values describes relationships between advertising channels and sales.

📈 The dataset was split into training and testing sets.Enter the valiant Linear Regression model, trained to predict sales based on the advertising triad: TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

📊 Model Triumph: Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), the gallant Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the heralded R-squared were employed to gauge the model's prowess.

🗂️Visual Enchantment: A bar plot showcased the difference between actual sales values and their predicted counterparts.
